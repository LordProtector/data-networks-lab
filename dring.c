 *
 * Implementation of a double ring.
 *
 * It is used for cyclic sequence numbers whereas the number of different sequence
 * numbers should be at least twice as large as the window size.
 *
 * The double ring stores data in two sorted queues. The first queue always
 * contains the "smaller" elements of the two queues. Elements are added to
 * the second queue if they are "larger" than elements of the first queue.
 * This is the case if they are numerically smaller AND the difference to the
 * largest element of the first queue is larger than the window size.
